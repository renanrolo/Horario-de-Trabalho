# Horario-de-Trabalho

In this simple project we can calculate how much time we have worked, but the thing I like most in this project is "If I stop working now, will I complete my workload or even I'm already overworking and how much time I overworked today?"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
